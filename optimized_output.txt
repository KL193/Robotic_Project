Good morning, everyone. We are here today to present our robotic project proposal, which we call 'Speaks.'

Speaks is a new tool designed to help you practice and perfect your presentations. For the hardware, we will be using a Raspberry Pi and an ESP32. On the software side, we will leverage the power of Microsoft Azure and Gemini.
