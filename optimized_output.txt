Good morning, everyone.

Today, I am excited to present our robotic project proposal, named "Speax."

For our hardware, we are utilizing a Raspberry Pi and an ESP32. On the software side, we are leveraging the power of Microsoft Azure and Google's Gemini APIs.

The core purpose of Speax is to help you practice and master your presentation skills, making it an incredibly helpful tool for university projects and beyond.

Thank you.
