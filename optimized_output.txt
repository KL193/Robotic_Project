Good morning, everyone. Today, I'm here to present our project proposal, called SPEECH.

SPEECH is a tool designed to help you practice and improve your presentation skills. For the hardware, we are using a Raspberry Pi and an ESP32. On the software side, our technology stack is built on powerful Azure and Gemini APIs. We believe this will be an incredibly valuable tool for anyone looking to perfect their presentations.
