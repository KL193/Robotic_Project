I am excited to present our proposal for a new robotics projectâ€”an amazing tool designed to build your confidence and revolutionize how you practice for presentations.

At its core, the system uses a Raspberry Pi, an OLED display, and is powered by Python.

Imagine no longer having to worry about your university presentations. This project is designed to help you deliver your message with boldness and confidence, empowering you to succeed.
