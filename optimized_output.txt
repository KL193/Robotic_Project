Today, I'd like to talk to you about biology.

At its core, biology is the study of life itselfâ€”from the tiniest microorganism to the largest creatures on Earth, including ourselves. It helps us understand the fundamental processes of how living things grow, reproduce, adapt, and interact with their environment.

The insights from biology are crucial. They allow us to understand the human body, advance medicine, improve agriculture, and tackle our most pressing environmental challenges. It is a subject profoundly connected to our everyday lives.
