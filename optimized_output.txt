Good morning, everyone.

Today, I am excited to present our new robotic project, which we call "Speaker."

Speaker is a personal robot designed to help you improve your presentations. Imagine you're practicing a speech, and a feedback light in front of you is red. Speaker provides real-time guidance to help you refine your delivery, with the goal of turning that light to a confident green.

It's all about helping you shine.

Thank you.
