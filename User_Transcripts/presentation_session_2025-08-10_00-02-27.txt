Today, I am excited to present our proposal for an innovative robotics project.

We are developing a specialized robot designed to be your personal presentation coach. For the hardware, we will utilize a Raspberry Pi and an ESP32, while the intelligence behind the robot will be powered by Google's Gemini AI.

The ultimate goal of this project is to help you build immense confidence and refine your public speaking skills. By practicing with this robot, you can become a bolder and more effective presenter. We are confident this will be an invaluable tool for anyone looking to master the art of presentation.
