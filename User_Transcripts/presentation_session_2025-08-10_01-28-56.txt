Today, I'm excited to introduce "Speaks," a tool designed to help you master your presentation skills.

Our system is built using an ESP32 and a Raspberry Pi for the hardware components. On the software side, we leverage Python, integrated with the powerful Azure and Gemini APIs.

We developed Speaks because we know how critical it is to deliver an outstanding presentation, whether you're in university or at your workplace. This tool acts as your personal practice partner, helping you refine your delivery so you can present with confidence.

By using Speaks, you can significantly improve your performance, ensuring you stand out and make a lasting impact on your audience. Our goal is to empower you to become the best presenter you can be.

Thank you.
